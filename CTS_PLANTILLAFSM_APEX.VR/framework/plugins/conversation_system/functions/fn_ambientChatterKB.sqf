----------
Parameters:
_receiver - OBJECT: Unit that receives the _sentences. - player
_topic - STRING: Topic needed for kbTell. - "MyTopic"
_sentences - ARRAY OF STRINGS: Sentence classes the NPCs will randomly pick from, defined in .bikb. - ["MySentence1", "MySentence2"]
_bikb - STRING (OPTIONAL): Path to the .bikb which contains the _sentence. - "mySentences.bikb" - DEFAULT: "sentences.bikb"
_subs - BOOLEAN (OPTIONAL): Show subtitles. - false - DEFAULT: true
_radius - NUMBER (OPTIONAL): Radius in metres around the _receiver in which random sentences should be triggered. - 10 - DEFAULT: 5
_cycle - NUMBER (OPTIONAL): Interval in seconds in which the script checks for near-by NPCs. - 3 - DEFAULT: 1
_sides - ARAAY OF SIDES: Sides of NPCs who are allowed to speak to the _receiver. - [west, east] - DEFAULT: [civilian, (side _receiver)]

Requires:
BRM_conversation_system_fnc_simpleSentenceKB
.bikb - File that contains class sentences. (See BI Wiki / documentation on the kbTell system.)
