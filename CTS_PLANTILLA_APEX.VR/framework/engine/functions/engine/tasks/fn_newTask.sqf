DESCRIPTION:

PARAMETERS:
    0 - Assignees: who will the task be assigned to. (SIDE/GROUP/UNIT)
    1 - The ID of the task. (STRING)
    2 - The details of the task. (ARRAY)

        1 - Description. (STRING)
    3 - Conditions. (ARRAY)
        0 - Condition for assignment. (STRING, but must evaluate to BOOLEAN)
        1 - Condition for completion. (STRING, but must evaluate to BOOLEAN)
        2 - Condition for failure. (STRING, but must evaluate to BOOLEAN)
    4 - Task priority. (NUMBER)
        0: Task will be declared "OPTIONAL" and is irrelevant to the mission.
        1: Similar to "OPTIONAL", but they behave as the middle ground,
        without failing the mission and not being essential to win.
        2: Essential tasks, which cannot be failed and must be completed.
    5 - Task event callback. (ARRAY)
        0 - Code executed when the task is assigned to the players. (STRING, but must evaluate to CODE)
        1 - Code executed whenever the mission is completed. (STRING, but must evaluate to CODE)
        2 - Code executed whenever the mission fails.
